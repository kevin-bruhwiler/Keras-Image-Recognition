# Keras-Image-Recognition
An image recognition program implemented in python with Keras

This code pulls images from two different folders and then trains a model which will process new images and determine which of the two folders it is most likely to belong to.

It was originally written to train a model for a RaspberryPi which would recognize a specific car and open the owner's garage door remotely when that car was identified. However it can easily be modified to categorize any number of different images into any number of different categories so long as sufficient training data is supplied.
